> Training examples sometimes need to be "batched" because not all data can necessarily be exposed to the algorithm at once (due to memory constraints usually).
> In the context of SGD, "Minibatch" means that the gradient is calculated across the entire batch before updating weights. If you are not using a "minibatch", every training example in a "batch" updates the learning algorithm's parameters independently.
